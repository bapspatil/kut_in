# Kut In

A Flutter app that shows random, wise Kanye West quotes. ðŸ˜‰

**Note**: This app was initially made for #FlutterCreate, a contest by Google that challenges developers to build a beautiful Flutter app using 5KB or less of Dart code. The first version of this app was my submission for the contest. The app will be under development for future enhancements starting April 2019.
